# This Python script reads a CSV file containing desired stocks with their symbols and company names.
# It then uses the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve daily closing prices for the past two days.
# Next, it calculates the percentage change in price and fetches relevant news articles from the News API.
# Finally, depending on the price change and user configuration, it sends SMS notifications via Twilio
# containing stock symbol, price change, top 3 headlines, and corresponding news bodies.
